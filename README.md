# Synapse AI- Instant Connections. Infinite Possibilites.

**Synapse AI** is a lightweight, Python-based personal assistant designed to run locally on a Raspberry Pi. It leverages powerful LLMs (such as Meta Llama API or OpenAI) to provide natural language responses and assist with everyday tasks â€” all without needing a browser or external UI. Once installed, it can autostart and run on boot, serving as a desktop AI companion.

## Features

* Runs automatically on Raspberry Pi at startup (autostart compatible)
* Lightweight and efficient, optimized for local terminal use
* Powered by OpenAI and/or Meta Llama API (fully customizable backend)
* Modular and easy to expand for voice, GUI, or smart home features
* Supports simple automation, task management, and local offline use (aside from AI queries)
* Ideal as a personal AI assistant, home server interface, or educational project

## Use Cases

* Personal AI assistant for daily tasks and Q\&A
* Simple automation and command-line interaction
* Expandable foundation for home automation or voice assistants
* Educational platform for learning Python and AI integration on Raspberry Pi
